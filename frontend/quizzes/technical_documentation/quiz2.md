Check out the documentation at https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started. There’s a lot to read 
there, and you won’t have to read through all of it. This quiz will test your ability to navigate a 
large suite of documentation to find answers to some questions. Each question has a clear part of the
documentation to find the answer, but additional information outside the documentation might be
useful to fully understand what the documentation is saying.
